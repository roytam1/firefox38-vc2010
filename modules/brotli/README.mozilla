This is the Brotli data compression library from
https://github.com/google/brotli.

Currently, we import only the Brotli decoder (the /dec/ subdirectory), not the
encoder (/enc/ subdirectory).

Upstream code can be viewed at
  https://github.com/google/brotli/tree/master/dec

and cloned by
  git clone https://github.com/google/brotli

Current version: [commit 29d31d5921b0a2b323ac24e7f7d0cdc9a3c0dd08].
