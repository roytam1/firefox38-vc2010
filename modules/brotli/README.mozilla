This is the Brotli data compression library from
https://github.com/google/brotli.

Currently, we import only the Brotli decoder (the /dec/ subdirectory), not the
encoder (/enc/ subdirectory).

Upstream code can be viewed at
  https://github.com/google/brotli/tree/master/dec

and cloned by
  git clone https://github.com/google/brotli

The in-tree copy is updated by running
  sh update.sh
from within the modules/brotli directory.

Current version: Release version 0.4.0 (June 14 2016).
